# Empathes - Extensible Minimum Path Estimator

Empathes is an implementation of the CI-NEB method for finding transition states.
It works as an interface for external programs (currently Gaussian and Siesta), from which it takes the information it needs, like molecular energies and atomic forces, to get the job done.
